Used languages: Python

Python version used: 3.9

Some problems that I could solve in Python language are in the python directory.

Some solutions work in Java but exact solution/algorithm doesn't WORK in Python! 
I don't know why? 
I put such files in "not solved" directory, so we can discuss about these if you'd like.
