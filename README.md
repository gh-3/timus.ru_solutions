# timus.ru_solutions

Used languages: Python

Python version used: 3.9

Some problems that I could solve in Python language are in the "python" directory.

Some solutions work in Java but exact solution/algorithm doesn't WORK in Python! 

I don't know why? 

I put such files and 
  also solutions that I think work but didn't accepted in timus
  in "not solved" directory, so we can discuss about these if you'd like.
